This script allows for the rotation of all passwords in the SDDC manager's control through a single script. The script will output these passwords to a CSV file as well as to the terminal. The root and admin passwords of the SDDC manager itself have been purposefully omitted to ensure that there is always a way to retrieve the passwords.
